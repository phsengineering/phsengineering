									<h1>V5 Systems Design</h1>
									<p>With the arrival of the new V5 system, we were able to implement designs which were limited by the less powerful motors of the Legacy hardware. After receiving the V5 system, our team built a second iteration of our robot. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/v5shot.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<div>
									<h3>Drivetrain</h3>
									<p>With the new V5 motors, we increased our maximum speed by 25% while reducing the number of motors required to drive it. In order to decrease the amount of time it took to mount the platforms, we placed a free rotating wheel at the front of the drive.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Lift</h3>
									<img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/lift.jpg"></img>
									<p>Our Legacy hardware robot could not place caps upon the posts. To address this, we adjusted our descorer so that it could also score caps. By using two bars that went across the cap, we were able to carry the cap through the full range of motion of the arm. Therefore, we can now grab caps of an opposite color on the floor and place it on our color on top of low posts.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Intake</h3>
									<p>The intake system again consists of two units: the indexer and front roller. The difference is that the front roller is expanded to the very edges of the drivetrain allowing for a wider intake system to allow for a higher intake speed. The ball enters the hood path by following two guide rails that are tensioned by rubber bands to hold position. The ball increases its height to enter the robot by bending down a piece of lexan tensioned in the back. This deployed down when intaking balls and back up when the balls enter the indexer consisting of 2 rollers that taper in size.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Flywheel</h3>
									<img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/hood.jpg"></img>
									<p>The flywheel for our V5 robot comes from the concept of a “perfect” flywheel. In context, the hood design has the maintained contact of a double flywheel while having the consistency of a single flywheel shot. For example, the prolonged contact as the ball spins through the hood increases the accuracy of the shot. In turn, the angle and direction similar to a single flywheel of the exit shot allows for a more consistent and precise shot. The flywheel is geared on a 5:1 ratio with a 600 rpm cartridge making the final rpm 3000.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<img src="images/image14.png"></img>
									<p>The new PROS and v5 SDKs opened a number of possibilities to make our robot more effective in competition. Use of haptic feedback from the new v5 controller was particularly useful for determining if our flywheel at its maximum velocity, or if the motor driving it was overheating. The built in PID control and motor telemetry features in PROS's motor API was also useful for keeping our robot's movements accurate during the autonomous period.</p>
